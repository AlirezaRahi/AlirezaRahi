## 🧬 About Me

From my early days in Computer Engineering, I’ve been fascinated by the power of algorithms to illuminate hidden patterns within complex biomedical data. My journey has spanned from independent exploratory projects—like breast cancer detection from mammography, lung cancer prediction from CT scans, retinal disease diagnosis, and cardiovascular risk prediction—to formal research contributions, including the release of globally balanced leukemia gene-expression datasets and the authorship of multiple peer-reviewed preprints and technical books.

I specialize in developing innovative deep learning solutions for medical imaging, with a focus on making AI interpretable and clinically relevant. My current doctoral research centers on brain tumor detection and segmentation using advanced architectures such as U-Net and Vision Transformers. I’m deeply committed to collaborative, open, and reproducible science that can directly support clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.
